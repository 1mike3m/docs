Use Automation Signup Forms to capture new contacts and add them directly to an Automation. You can either link to the signup form or directly embed it into your website. Currently, Signup Forms only connect to Automation contact lists. Once a contact has been added to the list they’ll automatically receive any live automations that are tied to the specified contact list.

## Create a new signup form

<call-out>

The number of signup forms you can store at a time is limited to 15. 

</call-out>

*To create a new Signup Form:*

1. Navigate to Automations and select **Signup Forms**. 
1. Click **Create New Form**.
1. On the Settings tab, add a Form Name and then select the contact list you want to link the form with. 
1. Next, add a confirmation message. This is the text that contacts will see once they’ve clicked submit on the form.
1. Navigate to the Build tab and add a header to the form. 
1. Add the intro copy to explain what the contact is signing up for. 
1. Select the checkboxes to add the fields you want on the form. 

## Manage signup forms

Using the action menu on the Signup Forms page you can edit, duplicate, or delete existing signup forms.

## Generate signup form code

Signup forms are hosted by SendGrid, so the code that’s being shared is just a link to the form itself, or an iframe displaying the form on your website. 

*To find the code for your signup form:*

1. Navigate to the signup form you want to share or embed.
1. Click the action menu and select **Share Code**.
1. On the *Integrate Form* modal, copy either the Landing Page or Direct Embed link. 
1. The Landing Page link can be pasted anywhere, including in an email or on a social media site. Use the Direct Embed link to populate the signup form on your website in an iframe.

You can also find the links to share the signup form in the design editor. To view the sharing links from the editor, click **Share Code** in the top-right corner of the page.
