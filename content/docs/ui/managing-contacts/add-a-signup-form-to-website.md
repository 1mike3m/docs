Use Automation Signup Forms to capture new contacts and add them directly to an Automation. You can either link to the signup form or directly embed it into your website. Currently, Signup Forms only connect to Automation contact lists. Once a contact has been added to the list they’ll automatically receive any live automations that are tied to the specified contact list.

## Create a new signup form

<call-out>

The number of signup forms you can store at a time is limited to 15. 

</call-out>

*To create a new Signup Form:*

1. Navigate to Automations and select **Signup Forms**. 
1. Click **Create New Form**.
1. On the Settings tab, add a Form Name and then select the contact list you want to link the form to. 
1. Next, add a confirmation message. This field contains the text that contacts will see once they’ve clicked submit on the form.
1. Navigate to the Build tab and add a header to the form. 
1. Add the intro copy to explain what the contact is signing up to receive. 
1. Select the checkboxes to add the fields you want on the form. 

## Manage signup forms

Use the action menu on the Signup Forms page to edit, duplicate, or delete existing signup forms.

## Generate signup form code

SendGrid currently hosts the signup forms for you, so the shared code is just a link to the site where SendGrid is hosting the form, or an iframe displaying the form on your website. 

*To find the code for your signup form:*

1. Navigate to the signup form you want to share or embed.
1. Click the action menu and select **Share Code**.
1. On the *Integrate Form* window, copy either the Landing Page or Direct Embed link. 
1. The Landing Page link can be pasted anywhere, including in an email or on a social media site. Use the Direct Embed link to populate the signup form on your website in an iframe.

You can also find the links to share the signup form in the design editor. To view the sharing links from the editor, click **Share Code** in the top-right corner of the page. 


### Adding signup form link to your website 

Embedding your signup form into a third-party website is as simple as pasting the embed code into your site's HTML. For more specific directions on how to do that on some popular site builders, see the links below:
