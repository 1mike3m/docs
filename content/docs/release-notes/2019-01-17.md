## Event Webhook Unique ID Specification Change

We have updated the length and format specification of the sg_event_id, [part of the JSON object]({{root_url}}/for-developers/tracking-events/event/#json-objects) included with each webhook post. Now, the sg_event_id will be limited to 100 characters, will be URL safe, and no longer has a specified format. You can use the sg_event_id to deduplicate events received by the webhook.

## Reverse DNS Improvements

The improved Reverse DNS process within sender authentication simplifies the process for senders to setup Reverse DNS to demonstrate domain and IP ownership to recipient mailbox providers in order to improve their email delivery. 

All pending and verified Reverse DNS records can  still be found under Reverse DNS within Sender Authentication. To learn more check out our how to docs or try it out in the SendGrid UI.
