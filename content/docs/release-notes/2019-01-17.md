## Event Webhook Unique ID Specification Change

We have updated the length and format specification of the sg_event_id, [part of the JSON object]({{root_url}}/for-developers/tracking-events/event/#json-objects) included with each webhook post. Now, the sg_event_id will be limited to 100 characters, will be URL safe, and no longer has a specified format. You can use the sg_event_id to deduplicate events received by the webhook.
