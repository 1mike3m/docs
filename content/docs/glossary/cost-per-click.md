Cost Per Click is the price you pay for each click in a pay-per-click advertising campaign. 

A pay-per-click advertising campaign is a digital marketing ad where every time your ad is clicked, and someone is sent to your site, you pay the advertiser a fee. This is most often the sponsored ads at the top of Google search results - so pay-per-click ads are not considered organic search results, they are ads generated search results.

Cost per click is determined by always being less than or equal to your max bid, you and your competetiors ad rank, and your Quality Score. Cost per click varies by industry and by your specific competitiors. Determine whether or not the cost you are paying per click has the necissary ROI to justify it - it's important to find a balance between cost and value. The best value clicks are both inexpensive and valuable. Of the factors that Google uses to calculate your cost is your Quality Score - accounts with a high Quality Score receives a discount, and accounts with a low quality score receive an increase in cost per click price. You can improve your quality score by creating high quality and targeted ads that lead to high quality and targeted webpages. Also, make sure to select negative keywords in your Adwords account, and keep this up to date. This filters out searchers who are unlikely to convert.
